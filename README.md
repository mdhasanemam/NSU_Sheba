NSU Sheba is your CSE299 project designed to be a comprehensive web-based student management system tailored for the North South University (NSU) community. It focuses on providing solutions to common student needs while promoting collaboration, convenience, and improved campus engagement.

Project Objectives:

To develop a single platform that simplifies the daily lives of NSU students.
To enhance academic support systems, social engagement, and service accessibility.
To utilize web technologies including PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS to create an interactive and efficient system.
Core Features of NSU Sheba:

Course Helping System: Students can find and connect with peers who can offer academic assistance in specific subjects, fostering a collaborative learning environment.

Food Vendor System: A marketplace where NSU students can buy food items from campus vendors, streamlining food access.

Book Vendor System: Facilitates buying and selling of textbooks and study materials, making it easier for students to acquire essential resources at affordable prices.

Event Management System for Clubs: Allows student clubs to manage, promote, and coordinate events, improving engagement and participation.

Poll Creation and Voting System: A democratic module where students can raise agendas, vote on topics, and contribute to campus-wide discussions. Voting is restricted to one vote per user and the system deletes agendas that do not reach a specified number of votes within a set timeframe.

Blood Bank: Enables students to register as blood donors, make blood donation requests, and respond to such requests. Donors receive notifications via PHPMailer when they accept a request, ensuring efficient communication and coordination within the NSU community. Requests can be removed by users, and donors can only accept a request once per need.

Tutor System: Connects students with qualified tutors who can offer subject-specific assistance, fostering academic growth and mutual support.

Technical Implementation:

Frontend and Backend Technologies: The project leverages PHP for server-side scripting, MySQL for database management, and HTML/CSS for creating user-friendly interfaces.
Security: Features like OTP verification for secure signup processes and prepared statements for database interactions to prevent SQL injection are included.
User Experience: Careful attention is given to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience, from intuitive navigation to dynamic forms and notifications.
NSU Sheba represents a thoughtful approach to solving real-world challenges faced by NSU students, making it a meaningful contribution as your CSE299 project. The system combines academic support, social services, and innovative modules, demonstrating your ability to create impactful software solutions using web development skills.
